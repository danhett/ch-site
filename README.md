# Cornerhouse Scribbler

### User-facing website

The user-facing site that allows message submission to the Cornerhouse Scribbler installation. 

This site is a one-page entry point that allows users to submit messages, and will also contain a live embedded stream of the gallery installation, so they can see their cards pop out in real time (more or less).
